# Project Plan: Inventory Management System

## Project Requirements

### Functional Requirements:

1. The application must allow users to add new products with a name, price, and stock quantity.
2. The application must provide functionality to update the stock of products (e.g., when sold or restocked).
3. Users should be able to view a list of all products along with their stock levels and prices.
4. The application must allow users to remove products from the inventory.
5. Users should be able to view a list of products with the lowest stock to help prioritize stocking decisions.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. The application should be simple and intuitive to use (text-based menu in the console).
2. It should run efficiently and handle larger inventories without performance issues.
3. The program should validate user input and handle invalid inputs gracefully.
4. The codebase should be modular and easy to read, maintain, and extend.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a simple, functional inventory management system.
2. Ensure product information (name, price, stock) is stored efficiently and uniquely within the application.
3. Incorporate control structures (e.g., `if-else`, `switch`) to implement a user-friendly menu for interacting with the
   application.
4. Utilize loops for tasks like iterating through the product list and validating user inputs.
5. Design, define, and call methods for a modular program structure, ensuring maintainability.
6. Introduce a feature to highlight products with low stock levels for better management decisions.
7. Break down tasks into smaller, manageable modules such as adding products, updating stock, viewing inventory, and
   removing products. These modules should implement methods, loops, and conditional statements to handle specific
   tasks.
8. Use efficient data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to manage product records and enable quick access to
   inventory data.
