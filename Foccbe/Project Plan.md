# Project Plan: Inventory Management System

## Project Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. The application must allow users to add new products with a name, price, and stock quantity.
2. The application must provide functionality to update the stock of products (e.g., when sold or restocked).
3. Users should be able to view a list of all products along with their stock levels and prices.
4. It must be possible to remove products from the inventory.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. The application should be simple and intuitive to use (text-based menu in the console).
2. It should run efficiently and handle larger inventories without performance issues.
3. The codebase should be modular and easy to read, maintain, and extend.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a simple, functional inventory management system.
2. Incorporate control structures (e.g., `if-else`, `switch`) to implement a user-friendly menu.
3. Utilize loops for tasks like iterating through the product list.
4. Design, define, and call methods for a modular program structure.
